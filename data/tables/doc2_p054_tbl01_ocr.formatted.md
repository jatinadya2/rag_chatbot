#### Important Notes
- Do not disperse used oil into the environment. Notify one of the authorized consortiums for collection and removal of used oil.

#### Periodic Checks
- Every 6 months, perform a thorough inspection of operation and wear, and precisely level the table.
- The gear unit requires no maintenance other than oil changes.

#### Adjusting the Machine
- **Adjusting the tension of the motor belts:** Ensure the motor belt tension is appropriate. Press down firmly on the individual belts (approximately in the middle), which should move by a maximum of 5 mm. If the belts are loose or too tight, adjust the belt tension system accordingly.

*Note: Proper belt tension reduces wear and increases the production of the machine.*
