Working close to the spindle

Before starting work in the vicinity of the spindle, ALWAYS check that the machine is stopped.

It is recommended to not extend the continued use of the machine for more than 10 minutes
to avoid overheating the machine (which could damage the motor) and the equipment.
1.  Lift the movable protective screen of the spindle.
2. Place the workpiece on the spindle and secure  it by tightening the jaws, with the
   appropriate key.
Insert the key into one of the holes with a square cross-section on the spindle, and to close
the jaws, turn it clockwise (see Figure 33).fervi.com
