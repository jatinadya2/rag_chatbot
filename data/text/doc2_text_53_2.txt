11.3.1     Adjusting the tension of the motor belts
Make sure the motor belt tension is at an appropriate level. In this regard, make a simple
check by pressing down firmly on the individual belts (approximately in the middle), which
should move by a maximum of 5 mm.
If the belts are loose or too tight, loosen the belt adjustment system bolts until the correct
tension is achieved.fervi.com
