 4.2.4 Feed speed adjustment panel

 The panel for the adjustment of the spindle rotation speed (see
 figure 5), is positioned at the left part of the machine, under the
 spindle speed adjustment panel. The lathe is provided with gears
 that can guarantee  the  considerable  availability  of  feeds and
 threads (metric and inch). The selection of the steps is made using
 4 rotary knob switches which control the gear speed change. There
 is also a fifth knob for selecting the feed direction of the carriage.
