 11.3.3     Spindle alignment
 When the spindle rotates off-axis or  if particularly heavy machining operations must be
 carried out, make an adjustment to the bearings.
 The bearing that supports the spindle is tapered, to carry out the adjustment, proceed as
 follows (see Figure 42):
 1. Loosen the bearing lock nut;
 2. Tighten the bearing adjustment nut;
 3. Test the spindle by rotating it, and — by means of a comparator (See Point 4 of Chapter
    10) — make sure it rotates perfectly.
 4. Re-tighten the bearing locking nut.
