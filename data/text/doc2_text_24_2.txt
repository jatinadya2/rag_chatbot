Loss of Stability

 Install the Lathe on a solid and strong support surface to avoid it falling over and vibrations;

 To ensure stability, excellent results and minimize vibrations, we recommend affixing the
 machine using the metal feet with threaded stems and rubber base. For the dimensions and
 the positions of the points of support, where the feet are put, see Figure 15.fervi.com                         Figure 15 â€“ Dimensions and fastening points.
