The panel for automatic feed speed adjustment (see Figure 19),  is
positioned at the left part of the machine, under the spindle rotation
speed adjustment panel.
The different speeds are selected via 4 knob switches which control the
gear speed change (ref. F, G, H, I in Figure 19). There is also a fifth
knob for selecting the feed direction of the carriage (ref. E in Figure
19).
