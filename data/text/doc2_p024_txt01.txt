Breaking of the guide rails

Make sure that the harnessing accessories are not touching the guide rails and the lead screw,
which could be damaged beyond repair.

1. Attach the hook of the lifting equipment (cranes, hoists, etc..) in the centre of harness
   accessories (between the two side ends) and lift slowly and smoothly.
The manufacturer declines  all responsibility for any damage to people and/or
objects caused by the improper lifting of the machine performed by unsuitable
personnel, with inappropriate lifting means and without following the instructions
in this manual.
