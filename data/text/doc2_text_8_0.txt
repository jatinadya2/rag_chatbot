 2.2 Safety rules for electrical machine equipment

      Changes in the Electrical System

 1. Do not modify the machine's electrical system in any way. Any attempt to do so may
    impair the operation of the electrical devices causing a malfunction or accident.
 2. Work on the electrical system of the machine must therefore be carried out only by
     qualified and authorised personnel.
 3.  If you hear unusual noises, or notice anything unusual, stop the machine immediately.
    Then, carry out an inspection and, if necessary, perform any repairs as required.
