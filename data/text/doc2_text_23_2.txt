7.2 Transportation
The transport of the machine can be carried out through the aid of vehicles and/or industrial
transportation vehicles, such as trucks, with containers of sufficient size to hold the machine
itself. The machine must be suitably anchored to the means of transport (for example,
through the aid of ropes).
During transport, the machine must be protected from rain, snow, hail, wind, and any other
adverse weather conditions. In this regard,  it is advisable to use means of transport with
closed compartments (vans, trucks etc.) or possibly covered with tarpaulin.
