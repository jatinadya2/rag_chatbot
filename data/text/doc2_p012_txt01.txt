The operating temperature range is -20 to +50°C.

The environment must also be sufficiently illuminated so as to ensure operation in maximum
safety (at least 200 lux is recommended).

There are two main groups within the Lathe (see figure 1):
      The spindle shaft unit;
      The sliding tool holder unit.

The first is constituted by the spindle, which is made integral with the workpiece, and by the
components that transmit motion from the motor to the spindle.

The second is constituted by the components that transmit motion to the slide, which guides
the tool in the feeding motion and movement of the workpiece.
