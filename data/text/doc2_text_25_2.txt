8.3.3 Levelling the lathe rails
Place the level on the sides of the carriage and move it slowly along its entire length while
checking that the bubble does not change.
If the bubble moves, adjust the adjustable feet until it reaches a uniform level throughout the
entire course of the carriage.
Periodically check these measurements (at least every six months).

Levelling the machine perfectly is one of the first and most essential steps to carry
out before using the machine.
