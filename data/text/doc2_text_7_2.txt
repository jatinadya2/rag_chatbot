 13. Firmly secure the workpiece before starting the lathe, using the jaws installed on the
      spindle.
 14. Always use the tool in an appropriate manner. Perform only the work for which the tool
       is made. Do not use the tool for inadequate work.
 15. Only use suitable resistance tools in relation to the work that is to be done. This is to
     avoid risky and unnecessary overloading for the operator, which may be harmful for
     the life of the tools themselves.
 16. Do not pick up moving tools or other moving parts. To stop the moving parts on the
     machine, always only use the stop command device.
