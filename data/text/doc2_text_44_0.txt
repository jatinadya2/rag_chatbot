 9 – Linear error compensation
 The linear error compensation function is used for the correction of errors in the transmission
 system of the lead screw.
 The correction factor is expressed as:
                                            L  L '                         S       mm / m
                                           L / 1000 

 where
 L is the useful length of the Z axis in mm;
 L’is the value displayed on the panel in mm;
 S is the correction factor in mm/m.

 The correction factor can be positive  if the displayed value is less than the actual length,
 negative if the value displayed is higher.
 The compensation range is ± 1.500 mm/m.
