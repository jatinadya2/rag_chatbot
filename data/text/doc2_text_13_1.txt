4.2.2 Head and spindle
The head is made of high strength cast iron, in addition two internal  protrusions which have
been introduced that increase rigidity, reducing vibration during high speed machining.
The different spindle speeds are obtained by means of a gear speed change (see also section
4.2.3 of this manual).
