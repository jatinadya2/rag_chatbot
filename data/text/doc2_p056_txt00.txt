11.3.4     Adjusting the slack of the gears

It is very important that there is no abnormal slack between
the gears, to avoid breakage or rapid wear of the teeth of the                                               II
gears themselves.

To reduce and / or adjust the slack , move the gear II and
firmly tighten nuts III and IV (see Figure 43 )
