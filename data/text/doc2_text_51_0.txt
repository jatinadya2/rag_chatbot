11.1Lubrication
It is good practice to clean the machine, especially the guides, removing all chips produced
by the work.
Apply, with a rag or a brush, a thin layer of oil on the guides and on the spindle to prevent
corrosion.
The next day, remember to remove the oil before starting the machine.
The perfect efficiency of the lathe is guaranteed over time with the perfect lubrication of its
moving parts.


      Lubrication

Do not use the machine if oil leaks are detected or if the levels are not perfect.
