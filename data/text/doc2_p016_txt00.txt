4.2.7 Steady rest
In the operations of drilling, boring and facing, the tailstock can not
be used to secure the work piece.
On the other hand,  if the pieces are long and heavy,  it  is not
enough to use only a self-centring spindle, but you must attach one
end of the work piece using a tool called a steady rest (see figure
8)
They are supplied with two rests: steady rest and follow rest
