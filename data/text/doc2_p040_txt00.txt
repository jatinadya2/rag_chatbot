5 – Displaying the absolute / relative coordinates

               Press the buttons            to move from the relative coordinates "INC" to the absolute
coordinates "ALE" and vice versa, on the display of the Y coordinate. Set the D plane as the
reference plane, in this way in "ALE" mode (absolute coordinates) on the Y axis 0 will be
displayed.

               0.       Y





                           Figure 30 – Viewing absolute / relative.

With reference to Figure 30  , proceed as follows, to switch from absolute coordinates to
relative coordinates.
    -  Bring the cutting tool to the D plane.
