The correction factor can be positive  if the displayed value is less than the actual length,
 negative if the value displayed is higher.
 The compensation range is Â± 1.500 mm/m.

 Ex. If the useful length of the Y axes is 1000 mm and the panel at the end of travel of the
 carriage, reads 999.98 mm then S=(1000-999.98)/(1000/1000)=0.02 mm/m.
 So to enter the compensation value it is necessary to:



                                                                             M/
      -  Select the Y axis by pressing the button        , pressing the      button displays the
        correction factor S previously set.
