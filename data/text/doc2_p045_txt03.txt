10 â€“ Disconnection of the power supply
 If the power supply  is disconnected or  it  is necessary to turn  off the machine during
 machining, the panel is able to automatically store the coordinates where the tool is located,
 the compensation factor currently set and the display mode.
 When the machine  is turned on again, the display  will show the exact data before the
 interruption, immediately after the initial self-diagnosis phase. If the tool and/or workpiece
 have not been moved, it is possible to resume machining without problems.
