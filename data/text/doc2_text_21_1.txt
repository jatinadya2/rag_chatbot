6 FORBIDDEN USES AND HAZARDS
The modes of use specified in this manual as incorrect, should never be permitted, under
any circumstances.

misuse and lack of maintenance can result in serious danger to the safety of the staff,
especially the operator, as well as affecting the functionality and the intrinsic safety of the
machine itself.
The following actions described, which obviously can not cover the entire range of potential
possibilities of "misuse" of the machine, are those which are "reasonably" more predictable
and should be considered strictly prohibited.
