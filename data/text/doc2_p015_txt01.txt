 4.2.5 Tool holder carriage
 The carriage sliding along the  rails of the bed  is used to hold,
 position and feed the tool. The various parts (see figure 6), are
 made of cast iron, with hardened and ground guides for greater
 stability. The carriage is equipped with an independent system that
 ensures the lubrication of the moving parts.
 The handwheels to move the carriage and the levers are easy to
 reach and easy to use.
