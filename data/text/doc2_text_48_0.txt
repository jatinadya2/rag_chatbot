 10.1Automatic Feed Tool Carriage
 Longitudinal feed
 The automatic longitudinal feed of the carriage is derived from spindle, which transmits its
 motion to the grooved bar (see Figure 35).
 The longitudinal feed is due to the lower slide that drags the carriage in the direction of the
 axis of the Lathe. A worm screw B, connected to the grooved bar A, runs along the latter
 together with the carriage. The worm screw sets in rotation a gear wheel D and the other
 gears present, including the pinion M which meshes with the rack N, which is moved by
 dragging the carriage during the rotation of the pinion.
