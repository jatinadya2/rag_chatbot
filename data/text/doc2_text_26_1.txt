8.4.3 Open circuit test
 Manually rotate the hand wheels on the carriage's tool carrier slides and tailstock quills to
 verify that these move freely and without friction.
 Start the machine by turning the main switch to the position I and the activation lever to
 reverse the rotation of the spindle (see Figure 16) and make sure that the electric motor and
 spindle are working properly.
 Test the operation of the lever for reversing the rotation of the electric motor.
 Test the brake pedal, the spindle should slow down and eventually stop.
 Test the emergency stop button, the whole machine should stop.
