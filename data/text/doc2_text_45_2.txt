Environment of Use

  The  lathe can operate  in enclosed working environments  (production departments,
   warehouses, etc.), such as those that are protected from the weather and where there is
   no danger of fire or explosion.
  The operating temperature is within the range of -10 / +50°C.
  The working environment must be sufficiently well  lit to ensure maximum operational
    safety (at least 200 lux).


     Working close to the spindle

Before starting work in the vicinity of the spindle, ALWAYS check that the machine is stopped.
