Figure 35 – Longitudinal feed.
 Transverse feed
 The transverse feed is due to the transverse slide which drags the upper slide and the tool in
 the perpendicular direction to the axis of the Lathe (see Figure 36). And by moving the lever
 E to position 3, the idler wheel O meshes with the pinion G integral with the screw H. The
 screw is coupled to the casing I integral with the transverse slide. The rotation of the screw
 therefore moves the transverse slide.fervi.com
