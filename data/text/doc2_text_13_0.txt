4.2.1 Supporting table
The supporting table (ref. 2 in figure 2 ) is made of cast iron; the casting has been stabilized
to avoid twisting and/or deformation due to the internal stresses in the material. In the upper
part there are prismatic guides that ensure the movement and alignment of the drive head
with the carriage and the moving head (tailstock). The guides are hardened and ground.
Reinforcements ribs have been incorporated that increase rigidity.
