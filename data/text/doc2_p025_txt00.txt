8 ASSEMBLY AND COMMISSIONING
 8.1 Identification of the installation site
 To install the machine, identify an area that is well  lit, away from wet areas and has no
 sources of vibration nearby.
 The lathe must be located so that adequate space is available for the operator, so you can
 use it to its full potential, and safely adjust, maintain and clean the machine. In this regard,
 an area of at least two square metres in front of the machine must be kept free.

       Installing the Machine

 Do not install the Machine outdoors to avoid deformation, loss of function and damage to the
